# ct-SFTM
Simulation code for continuous-time Structural Failure Time Models (ctSFTM)

The previous code for [ctSFTM][id] only allows low-dimensional covariates change on a regular space. 

The R code in this repository allows high-dimensional covariates change on a continuous-time scale.

It serves as a base for constructing the continuous-time Structural Failure Time Models with intermittent treatments.
